### Staying up to date

Consider [signing up](http://sdk.sphero.com/sign-up) for our SDK email list to stay current on new features being released in our robot firmware as well as our SDKs, including new platform / language support.

# micro:bit Python SDK

This module contains the set of commands that allow the micro:bit to communicate with the [Sphero RVR](https://www.sphero.com/rvr) robot.

In order to use the SDK, `sphero.py` will need to be copied onto the micro:bit, along with the Python file to be run.

The drive commands can be accessed by typing `from sphero import RVRDrive, RawMotorModes` at the top of the Python file.
<br>The **RawMotorModes** class is only used to specify the _left\_mode_ and _right\_mode_ values of the **set\_raw\_motors** command, and may be excluded from the import statement if the user does not wish to use this command.

The LED commands can be accessed by typing `from sphero import RVRLed, LEDs` at the top of the Python file.
<br>The **LEDs** class is only used to specify the _index_ value of the **set\_rgb\_led\_by\_index** command, and may be excluded from the import statement if the user does not wish to use this command.

The power commands can be accessed by typing `from sphero import RVRPower` at the top of the Python file.

**Note:** Due to the micro:bit's memory constraints, `sphero.py` contains a lot of seemingly arbitrary hexadecimal values. This is not good programming practice, and was only used to allow as much space for the user as possible in the micro:bit's limited memory.


## RVRDrive

The class containing all RVR drive commands. All drive commands are static, and can be called by typing `RVRDrive.<command>`.
    
**Examples:**
    
    RVRDrive.drive(60, 90)
    RVRDrive.set_raw_motors(RawMotorModes.FORWARD, 80, RawMotorModes.FORWARD, 80)
    RVRDrive.reset_yaw()
   
**Note:** Unless stated otherwise, the commands will not work if the provided values are outside of the specified ranges.

* **drive**(*speed*, *heading*): drives the robot at the given speed with the given heading.
  * *speed* (int): an integer from 0-255
  * *heading* (int): an integer from 0-359 degrees (0 is forwards, 90 is to the right, 180 is backwards, and 270 is to the left)
* **stop**(*heading*): tells the robot to stop driving. The heading should be the robot's current heading.
  * *heading* (int): an integer from 0-359 (0 is forwards, 90 is to the right, 180 is backwards, and 270 is to the left)
* **set\_raw\_motors**(*left\_mode*, *left\_speed*, *right\_mode*, *right\_speed*): sets the motors' modes and speeds individually. If a mode value outside of the 0-2 range is given, the mode will default to 0 (off).
  * *left\_mode* (**RawMotorModes**): a member of the **RawMotorModes** class representing the drive mode for the left motor (OFF, FORWARD, BACKWARD)
  * *left\_speed* (int): an integer from 0-255
  * *right\_mode* (**RawMotorModes**): a member of the **RawMotorModes** class representing the drive mode for the right motor (OFF, FORWARD, BACKWARD)
  * *right\_speed* (int): an integer from 0-255
* **reset\_yaw**(): sets the robot's current yaw angle to zero.

## RVRLed

The class containing all RVR LED commands. All LED commands are static, and can be called by typing `RVRLed.<command>`.
    
**Examples:**

    RVRLed.set_all_leds(0, 0, 255)
    RVRLed.set_rgb_led_by_index(LEDs.RIGHT_STATUS, 140, 125, 240)
    
**Note:** The commands will not work if the provided values are outside of the specified ranges.

* **set\_all\_leds**(*red*, *green*, *blue*): sets all of RVR's LEDs to the color represented by the given red, green, and blue values.
  * *red* (int): an integer from 0-255 indicating the desired red value
  * *green* (int): an integer from 0-255 indicating the desired green value
  * *blue* (int): an integer from 0-255 indicating the desired blue value
* **set\_rgb\_led\_by\_index**(*index*, *red*, *green*, *blue*): sets the indicated LED to the color represented by the given red, green, and blue values.
  * *index* (**LEDs**): a member of the **LEDs** class used to specify which LED is to be set
  * *red* (int): an integer from 0-255 indicating the desired red value
  * *green* (int): an integer from 0-255 indicating the desired green value
  * *blue* (int): an integer from 0-255 indicating the desired blue value

## RVRPower

The class containing all RVR power commands. All power commands are static, and can be called by typing `RVRPower.<command>`.

**Examples:**

    RVRPower.sleep()
    RVRPower.wake()

* **sleep**(): puts the robot in a soft sleep state.
* **wake**(): wakes the robot from sleep.
